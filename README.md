Hi everyone. I am a college Pharmacy student with a knack for research. I am a researcher for BAC Inc. and the Near Research Collective as well as the Community Manager and one of the Council Member for the [Near Research Collective](https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=research-collective.sputnik-dao.near). I'm still learning and getting familiarized with the various platforms. It's fun here.
I write guides and articles sometimes. Intern with [Marma J Foundation](https://twitter.com/itsmarmaj).
